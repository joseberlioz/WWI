      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>World War I was a global conflict that took place from 1914 to 1918. It involved many of the world's nations, including all of the great powers, which were eventually divided into two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Central Powers. The causes of the war are complex and varied, but it is generally agreed that a combination of political, economic, and cultural factors played a role.</p>

        <h2>Political causes</h2>
        <p>One of the main political causes of World War I was the complex network of alliances that had been formed between the major European powers in the decades leading up to the war. These alliances were designed to protect the interests of the individual nations and to deter potential aggression from other powers. However, they also created a web of interconnected commitments that made it difficult for any one nation to back down from a conflict without risking the anger and disappointment of its allies.</p>
        <p>Another significant political factor that contributed to the outbreak of World War I was the rise of nationalism in Europe. Nationalism is a belief in the superiority of one's own nation and a desire to promote its interests above those of other countries. This led to increased tensions between the various nations as they competed for resources, territory, and influence.</p>

        <h2>Key event</h2>
        <p>The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary in 1914 was a key event that set off a chain of events leading to the outbreak of the war. Ferdinand was the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, and his assassination by a Serbian nationalist sparked a diplomatic crisis between Austria-Hungary and Serbia. This crisis eventually led to the mobilization of military forces by the major powers and the outbreak of hostilities.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In summary, the political background of World War I was shaped by the complex network of alliances between the major European powers, the rise of nationalism, and the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand. These factors, along with a variety of economic and cultural influences, contributed to the outbreak of the war and the global conflict that ensued.</p>
